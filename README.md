# AWS-RESOURCE-TRACKING-USING-SHELL-SCRIPTING

This project provides a simple and effective way to track AWS resources using shell scripting and cron job. The script utilizes the AWS CLI to fetch information about different AWS services, such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users. The cron job can be scheduled to run the script at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, to provide up-to-date Information on AWS resource usage,to improve DevOps efficiency.
